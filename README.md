## Git basics

1. working directory --> 2) local --> 3) Remote

### Working Directory

Any changes you have made to the repo (but havn't commited yet)

### Local

When you have staged and committed your changes they exist on the local repo

### Remote

Changes which you have made locally but subsequently 'pushed' to remote repo.
(When you work with other peoplethey can also make changes to the remote repo,
and you may need to 'pull' the changes)

## How to commit my changes

First I need to stage my changes in the working directory

- git add file_name

Then add a commit message

- git commit -m 'This is a commit message'

## How to make my local changes reflect in the remote repo

- git push

## How do I get other peoples changes that they have made in the remote repo?

- git pull
